The Site Test module is an extension of the Drupal core Simpletest module for
running site specific tests in place on an active Drupal installation. The core
Simpletest module creates a new Drupal installation with a blank database every
time it runs a test creating a large bottleneck and removing the ability to test
with real-world data and configuration.
