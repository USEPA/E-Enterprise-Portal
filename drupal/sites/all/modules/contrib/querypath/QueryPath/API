Changes in 2.1

All changes are documented in their respective doc blocks. So take a 
look at http://api.querypath.org to learn more.

New Functions
  * The `htmlqp()` method has been added for parsing icky HTML. Use
    this for web scraping.

Altered Functions
  * The qp() function now supports the following new options:
    - convert_to_encoding
    - convert_from_encoding
    - strip_low_ascii
    - use_parser

New Methods
  * attach()/detach()
  * has()
  * emptyElement()
  * even()/odd()
  * first()/last()
  * firstChild()/lastChild()
  * nextUntil()/prevUntil()
  * parentsUntil()
  * encodeDataURL()
  * dataURL()
  * filterPreg()
  * textBefore()/textAfter()

Altered Methods
  * css() has been changed to allow subsequent calls
    to modify the style attribute (issue #28)
  * attr() has been changed. If it is called with no 
    arguments, it now returns all attributes.

New CSS Selectors Behavior

  * :contains-exactly() performs as :contains() used to perform.

Altered CSS Selectors Behavior

  * The star operator (*) is now non-greedy, per spec. Before, the star would match
    any descendants. Now it will only match children.
  * :contains() now does substring matching instead of exact matching. This conforms
    to jQuery's behavior.
  * Quotes are now checked carefully before being stripped from pseudo-class values.
  * Issue #40 identified a potential infinite looping problem on poorly formed selectors.
    This was fixed.
