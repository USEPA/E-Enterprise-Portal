RELEASE NOTES

Big Changes:

1. There is now an `htmlqp()` function that parses crufty HTML in a far
more reliable way than `qp()`. Use this instead of any variant of 
the older `@qp()` setup.

2. The API has been brought into alignment with jQuery 1.4. See 
API-2.1.0 for details.

3. This release was driven substantially by eabrand's GSOC 2010 
contributions. Thanks, Emily!

4. There are now Phar and PEAR packages available. Got to 
http://pear.querypath.org for PEAR packages.

5. The minimal QP distribution is no longer minified, as it reportedly
causes XDebug to crash.

7. Data URs are now supported. QueryPath can now embed images directly
into HTML and XML this way.

8. Documentation is now in Doxygen instead of PhpDocumentor. Thanks
to Matt Farina and Kevin O'Brien for their input.
