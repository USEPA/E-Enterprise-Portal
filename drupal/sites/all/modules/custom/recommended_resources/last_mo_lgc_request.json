Since the program's inception in 1993, Missouri has funded 358 grants statewide, totaling $25,589,620. The program's purpose is to help provide and maintain recreational trails and trail-related facilities for both motorized and non-motorized recreational use. Examples of recreational trail uses include hiking, biking, in-line skating, equestrian use, water trails, off-road motorcycling, all-terrain vehicle riding, and off-road motorized use. RTP grants are available to for-profit and not-for-profit private organizations, such as youth organizations, trail clubs, land trusts, conservation organizations, private schools, and private operators of recreational facilities open to the public; to municipal agencies such as cities, towns, counties, school districts, and public utilities; and to state agencies and state public education institutions. Eligible project categories include constructing new recreational trails, including water trails; acquisition or lease of land or right-of-way easements for recreational trails; rehabilitation or repair of existing recreational trails, trailside amenities, trailhead facilities and/or trail linkages; purchase and/or lease of recreational trail construction and maintenance equipment; assessment of trail conditions for accessibility and maintenance; and educational projects to promote safety and environmental protection related to the use of recreational trails. The grant maximum is $150,000 for trail-related projects and $25,000 for educational projects. The minimum grant request is $25,000 for trail-related projects and $5,000 for educational projects.
