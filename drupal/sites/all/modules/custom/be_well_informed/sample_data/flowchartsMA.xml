              <b>Can consuming water containing arsenic affect my health?</b>  Consuming water containing more than 0.010 mg/L of arsenic is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the skin, bladder, lungs, kidneys, nasal passages, liver, or prostate as well as diseases of the nerves, lungs, heart, and immune and endocrine (hormonal) systems.  Your individual health risk depends on the amount of arsenic in your water, how much of the water you drink each day, and the number of years you drink the water.  To reduce your exposure to arsenic in your well water, treat the water that you use for drinking and cooking to a level less than 0.010 mg/L.  You can continue to use your water for washing food and dishes, brushing your teeth, bathing, showering, and for other uses.

              <b>How can I reduce the level of arsenic in my water?</b>  In addition to arsenic, your test results show that your water also contains more than 0.1 mg/L of iron and manganese, which must be considered in the selection of a water treatment system.  Install one of the following water treatment systems to reduce the level of iron, manganese, and arsenic in your water:
              <br /><ol><li>
                  An NSF/ANSI Standard 42 certified whole house oxidizing filter system that uses chlorine or permanganate as the oxidizing agent to reduce the level of iron and manganese.  This type of system will also reduce the level of arsenic in your water, though by how much depends on the levels of iron, pH, and arsenic.  You may also need to install one of the following systems if additional arsenic reduction is needed:
                  <ol type="a"><li>An NSF/ANSI Standard 53 certified arsenic adsorption media filter system.  This system may be a point-of-use (POU) system at your kitchen sink designed to treat only the water that you consume, or it may be a whole house system; or</li><li>An NSF/ANSI Standard 58 certified point-of-use (POU) reverse osmosis (RO) system at your kitchen sink designed to treat only the water that you consume.</li></ol></li><br /><b>OR</b><br /><br /><li>
                  An NSF/ANSI Standard 44 certified whole house cation exchange water softener to reduce the level of iron and manganese, in combination with one of the following systems to reduce the level of arsenic:
                  <ol type="a"><li>An NSF/ANSI Standard 53 certified arsenic adsorption media filter system.  This system may be a point-of-use (POU) system at your kitchen sink designed to treat only the water that you consume, or it may be a whole house system; or</li><li>An NSF/ANSI Standard 58 certified point-of-use (POU) reverse osmosis (RO) system at your kitchen sink designed to treat only the water that you consume.</li></ol></li></ol><br /><ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>
                  If your arsenic level is 0.025 mg/L or more, request an “arsenic speciation test” from your laboratory to ensure that the treatment method being considered results in the best possible reduction of arsenic.

Your choice of treatment system could change, or the long-term performance of the system could be negatively affected, depending on the level of iron and manganese in your water; however, you did not provide test results for iron and manganese.
              <br /><ol><li>
                  An NSF/ANSI Standard 53 certified whole house anion exchange water treatment system, followed by an acid neutralizer to prevent corrosion of your home’s plumbing from the anion exchange system.  To ensure the best possible reduction of arsenic, request an “arsenic speciation test” from your laboratory.  If you have any arsenic III (arsenite), install an NSF/ANSI Standard 42 certified whole house oxidizing pretreatment filter system that uses manganese dioxide as the oxidizing agent to convert arsenic III to arsenic V (arsenate).
                </li><br /><b>OR</b><br /><br /><li>
                  An NSF/ANSI Standard 53 certified point-of-use (POU) arsenic adsorption media filter system at your kitchen sink designed to treat only the water that you consume. A whole house adsorption system is not recommended, because of the increased frequency of maintenance due to your high arsenic level.

              <b>Can consuming water containing copper affect my health?</b>  Consuming water containing more than 1.3 mg/L of copper can cause vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, and nausea.  Children under one year old have the highest risk of getting sick.  High levels of copper in water can also cause liver or kidney damage the longer you drink the water.  Also, if you or someone in your household has Wilson’s Disease, you should talk with your doctor about the level of copper in your water.  The presence of copper in your water may also indicate that other pollutants, such as lead, may be present in your water.<br /><br />
              You can continue to use your water for washing food and dishes, brushing your teeth, bathing, showering, and for other uses, as these are not considered major sources of exposure.<br /><br /></Content>

                <li>
                  If you haven’t already done so, you should also test your water for lead, which can cause serious health problems, especially for babies, children, and pregnant women.

                <li>
                  Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making baby food and formula. Hot water from the tap is likely to contain higher levels of lead and copper.  In most cases, you can reduce the level of lead and copper in the water that you use for drinking and cooking by clearing the water from the pipes before using it.  Click <a class="contaminant-link" data-contaminant="Cu1" style="cursor: pointer;">here</a> for instructions on flushing out your plumbing.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Copper (and lead) levels may be high in your water because of the materials used in your home’s plumbing and how acidic your water is.  Metals, such as copper and lead, can leach from pipes and plumbing fixtures when water is acidic.  When copper leaches from plumbing, it can cause water to have a metallic taste or cause blue-green staining on surfaces that come in contact with the water.  If you haven’t already done so, you should also test the pH of your water, which will tell you if your water is acidic.<br /><br />
                  If your water is acidic (pH is less than 7.0), install a whole house acid neutralizer system, such as a calcite filter, to increase the pH and make the water less acidic, which should reduce the level of copper (and lead) in your water.<br /><br />
                  Another option is to remove the source of copper by replacing your copper plumbing and fixtures with other approved materials, such as plastic.<br /></li>
              </ol>
              <br />
              <div Id="Cu1" style="display:none; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;">
                In most cases, flushing out your plumbing will reduce the copper (and lead) level in your water. The routine of letting the water run to get the copper (and lead) out should be done each morning and if the water has not been used for more than six hours – for example, overnight or during the day when you have been out of the house.  To “flush the tap,” turn on the cold water faucet and let the water run for at least 15 seconds.  If you need hot water for drinking or cooking, take water from the cold water tap and heat it.<br /><br />
                Other household water uses, such as showering or toilet flushing, will also help clear water from your plumbing. Keep in mind that you will still need to run individual faucets for a short time before using them for cooking and drinking water. You may want to keep a container of water in your refrigerator, so that the water does not have to be run every time you need it.<br /><br />
                Corrosive water can result in damage to plumbing which can also result in increased levels of lead and copper.

              <b>Can consuming water containing fluoride affect my health?</b>  Consuming water containing more than 4.0 mg/L of fluoride can cause bone disease, which can include pain and tenderness of the bones and irregular bone deposits that can cause arthritis and crippling when occurring at joints (skeletal fluorosis).<br /><br />
              Consuming water containing more than 2.0 mg/L of fluoride can cause small ‘white spots’ on children’s teeth (mottled enamel), or in extreme cases, brown staining or pitting of teeth that are still developing below the gums (dental fluorosis).<br /><br />
              To reduce your exposure to fluoride in your well water, treat the water that you use for drinking and cooking to a level less than 2.0 mg/L.  If treatment is not feasible, children under nine years old should be provided with an alternative source of drinking water that contains less than 2.0 mg/L of fluoride.<br /><br />
              Consuming water containing an optimal level of fluoride helps protect against tooth decay.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ recommended optimal range for fluoride in drinking water is 0.6 - 0.8 mg/L.  You should talk with your dentist and doctor about the level of fluoride in your water and how you can reduce your and your family’s total fluoride exposure.

              Elevated levels of iron can cause a metallic taste, bad smell, rusty-colored water, mineral deposits or sedimentation, or reddish or orange staining on laundry or surfaces that come in contact with the water.  None of these effects poses a health risk.<br /><br />
              Elevated levels of iron or manganese (commonly found together in water wells) may also cause the growth of iron or manganese bacteria, which produce a slime that can clog filters and plumbing. Although these bacteria can make water unappealing and cause a bad taste or smell, there is no health risk associated with them.<br /><br /></Content>

              <b>How can I reduce the level of iron in my water?</b>  In addition to iron, your test results show that your water also contains more than 0.1 mg/L of manganese, which must be considered in the selection of a water treatment system.  Install an NSF/ANSI Standard 42 certified whole house oxidizing filter system that uses chlorine or permanganate as the oxidizing agent to reduce the level of iron and manganese in your water.  This type of system will also reduce the level of arsenic in your water, if present; however, you did not provide test results for arsenic.  How much arsenic can be removed by this type of system depends on the levels of iron and arsenic.

              <b>Can consuming water containing lead affect my health?</b>  Consuming water containing more than 0.015 mg/L of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for babies, children, and pregnant women.<br /><br />
              Babies and children who consume water containing more than 0.015 mg/L of lead could experience long-term problems with physical and mental growth and development, including slowed body growth, kidney problems, hearing problems, seizures, brain damage, lower IQ level, trouble learning, reduced attention span, and behavior problems.<br /><br />
              Pregnant women and their unborn babies are especially at risk from consuming water containing more than 0.015 mg/L of lead.  Lead exposure can seriously harm the unborn baby, causing premature birth, lower birth weight, and delayed mental and physical development.<br /><br />
              Adults who consume water containing more than 0.015 mg/L of lead may be at higher risk for cancer, stroke, and high blood pressure and could develop nervous system problems, kidney problems, anemia, and decreased sperm production in men.<br /><br />
              The presence of lead in your water may also indicate that other pollutants, such as copper, may be present in your water.<br /><br />
              You can continue to use your water for washing food and dishes, brushing your teeth, bathing, showering, and for other uses, as these are not considered major sources of exposure.<br /><br /></Content>

              <br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If you haven’t already done so, you should also test your water for copper.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making baby food and formula. Hot water from the tap is likely to contain higher levels of lead and copper.  In most cases, you can reduce the level of lead and copper in the water that you use for drinking and cooking by clearing the water from the pipes before using it.  Click <a class="contaminant-link" data-contaminant="Pb1" style="cursor: pointer;">here</a> for instructions on flushing out your plumbing.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Lead (and copper) levels may be high in your water because of the materials used in your home’s plumbing and how acidic your water is.  Metals, such as lead and copper, can leach from pipes and plumbing fixtures when water is acidic.  If you haven’t already done so, you should also test the pH of your water, which will tell you if your water is acidic.<br /><br />
                  If your water is acidic (pH is less than 7.0), install a whole house acid neutralizer system, such as a calcite filter, to increase the pH and make the water less acidic, which should reduce the level of lead (and copper) in your water.<br /><br />
                  Another option is to remove the source of lead by replacing your lead or galvanized iron pipes and fittings, lead-soldered pipes, and brass or chrome fixtures with other approved materials, such as plastic.<br /></li>
              </ol>
              <br />
              <div Id="Pb1" style="display:none; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;">
                In most cases, flushing out your plumbing will reduce the lead (and copper) level in your water. The routine of letting the water run to get the lead (and copper) out should be done each morning and if the water has not been used for more than six hours – for example, overnight or during the day when you have been out of the house.  To “flush the tap,” turn on the cold water faucet and let the water run for at least 15 seconds.  If you need hot water for drinking or cooking, take water from the cold water tap and heat it.<br /><br />
                Other household water uses, such as showering or toilet flushing, will also help clear water from your plumbing. Keep in mind that you will still need to run individual faucets for a short time before using them for cooking and drinking water. You may want to keep a container of water in your refrigerator, so that the water does not have to be run every time you need it.<br /><br />
                Corrosive water can result in damage to plumbing which can also result in increased levels of lead and copper.

              <b>Can consuming water containing manganese affect my health?</b>  Consuming water containing more than 0.3 mg/L of manganese may be harmful to children.  Studies suggest that elevated levels of manganese may affect the brain development of children, possibly causing changes in behavior and a decreased ability to learn and remember.<br /><br />
              Pregnant women, babies, and children under three years old should not consume water containing 0.3 mg/L or more of manganese.  Extra care should be taken with formula-fed children, as certain formulas contain manganese, and if prepared with water that also contains manganese, the child may get a higher dose than the rest of the family.  To reduce your family’s exposure to manganese, treat the water that you use for drinking and cooking to reduce the level of manganese to be less than 0.3 mg/L or use an alternative source of water that contains less than 0.3 mg/L of manganese.<br /><br />
              Elevated levels of manganese can cause a metallic taste, bad smell, rusty-colored water, mineral deposits or sedimentation, or brown or black staining on laundry or surfaces that come in contact with the water.  None of these effects poses a health risk.<br /><br />
              Elevated levels of iron or manganese (commonly found together in water wells) may also cause the growth of iron or manganese bacteria, which produce a slime that can clog filters and plumbing. Although these bacteria can make water unappealing and cause a bad taste or smell, there is no health risk associated with them.<br /><br /></Content>

              <b>Can consuming water containing nitrate affect my health?</b>  Babies under six months old who consume water containing more than 10 mg/L of nitrate can develop “blue-baby syndrome” (methemoglobinemia), which can cause coma and death.  Poisoning can occur when babies drink formula made with nitrate- or nitrite-polluted water.  Babies who are exposed to nitrate may seem healthy at first and show only mild symptoms, including a bluish or purplish color in their lips, nose, ears, nails, hands, or feet.  In some cases, babies may also have trouble breathing or develop vomiting and diarrhea.  Symptoms can develop quickly from very minor exposure. Seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms occur.<br /><br />
              Studies continue on the effects of nitrate exposure during pregnancy. The safest choice for pregnant women is to avoid consuming water that has high levels of nitrate because of potential effects on their unborn baby.<br /><br />
              Breastfed babies, children over six months old, and adults are generally not at risk for developing methemoglobinemia.  However, people with chronic health problems, such as heart or lung disease or enzyme deficiencies, may be at higher risk from elevated nitrate levels.  Nitrate is also being studied for long-term links to cancer.  Talk with your doctor about the level of nitrate in your water if you have concerns.  Nitrate in water is not a health concern when bathing or showering.<br /><br /></Content>

              Nitrate in drinking water at levels above 10 mg/L is a serious health risk for babies under six months old.  High nitrate levels can cause “blue-baby syndrome” (methemoglobinemia), which can cause coma and death.  Poisoning can occur when babies drink formula made with nitrate-polluted water.<br /><br />
              Studies also continue on the effects of nitrate exposure during pregnancy. The safest choice for pregnant women is to avoid consuming water that has high levels of nitrate because of potential effects on their unborn baby.<br /><br />
              Nitrate levels may rise quickly for short periods of time because of rainfall or agricultural activity. If you are caring for an infant or someone in your household is pregnant, talk with your doctor about the level of nitrate in your water.<br /><br /></Content>

                To fix the total coliform bacteria problem in your well water, take these steps:
                <br /><ol><li>
                    Inspect the condition of your wellhead and the area around it - check your well’s cap and casing to make sure there are no cracks or holes where bacteria can enter your well; and check for possible sources of pollution, such as septic systems, and waste from pets and farm animals.  Also, make sure rain and melting snow are directed away from your wellhead.  If you cannot find your wellhead, it may be buried and need to be dug up.</li><br /><li>
                    Once you have taken care of any potential sources of pollution, disinfect your well and collect another water sample.  See the Disinfection Section of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/water/drinking/private-wells.html">here</a> for instructions on how to disinfect your well.
                  </li><br /><li>
                    If the bacteria problem continues, there may be a problem with the construction of your well that is allowing bacteria to easily enter it. In this case, contact an MA-certified well driller to get an assessment of your well and have any construction-related problems fixed.

                To avoid getting sick from consuming water containing E. coli bacteria, boil all water that you use for drinking, brushing teeth, washing fruits and vegetables, food preparation, washing dishes, making baby food and formula, and making ice or use an alternative source of water that is known to be safe, such as bottled water, until the problem is fixed and E. coli bacteria are absent.  Water should be boiled for two minutes and cooled before using it. Dishes can be safely washed in a dishwasher if you use the hot water/sanitary cycle setting and the dry cycle. You can continue to use your water for bathing and showering as long as you do not drink it; extra care should be taken with small children.

Radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in people who never smoke, and the second leading cause of lung cancer overall. The greater the exposure to radon, especially if you smoke cigarettes, the greater your chance of developing lung cancer. If you haven’t already done so, you should also test the air in your home for radon gas if you live below the third floor. A secondary concern is the risk of cancer associated with the ingestion of drinking water with radon.<br /></Content>

              <b>Can consuming water containing uranium affect my health?</b>  Consuming water containing more than 30 ug/L of uranium is associated with an increased risk of cancer and kidney damage.  Your individual health risk depends on the amount of uranium in your water, how much of the water you drink each day, and the number of years you drink the water.  To reduce your exposure to uranium in your well water, treat the water that you use for drinking and cooking to a level less than 30 ug/L.  You can continue to use your water for washing food and dishes, brushing your teeth, bathing, showering, and for other uses.
