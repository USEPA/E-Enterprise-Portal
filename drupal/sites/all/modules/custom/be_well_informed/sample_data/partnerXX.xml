         Based on what you entered from your laboratory report, the Results Summary below indicates whether your water meets federal and
         state health-based standards (Maximum Contaminant Levels - MCLs) as well as other guidelines (Secondary Maximum Contaminant
         Levels - SMCLs, health advisory levels, etc.). These standards and guidelines are often referred to as "limits" on your laboratory
         report. If your water exceeds or is approaching established federal/state drinking water limits or advisory levels for the contaminant(s)
         entered, additional health information and treatment options will be shown. <b>Several contaminants, such as radon and sodium, <span class="em-und">do
         not have state or federal standards</span></b>. Instead, when radon is present in drinking water at 2,000 pCi/L or greater, NHDES
         recommends homeowners <span class="em-und">consult NHDES Fact Sheet WD-DWGB-3-12 (Revised 3/14/2016)</span>. For sodium, the Be Well Informed tool
         provides health and treatment information when sodium is present at levels above 20 mg/L, U.S. EPA's federal "health advisory" for
         persons on a physician-prescribed "no salt diet."
