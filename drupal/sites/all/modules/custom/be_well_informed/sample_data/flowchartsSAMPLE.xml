              <b>Can consuming water containing arsenic affect my health?</b>  Consuming water containing more than 0.010 mg/L of arsenic is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the skin, bladder, lungs, kidneys, nasal passages, liver, or prostate as well as diseases of the nerves, lungs, heart, and immune and endocrine (hormonal) systems.  Your individual health risk depends on the amount of arsenic in your water, how much of the water you drink each day, and the number of years you drink the water.  To reduce your exposure to arsenic in your well water, treat the water that you use for drinking and cooking to a level less than 0.010 mg/L.  You can continue to use your water for washing food and dishes, brushing your teeth, bathing, showering, and for other uses.

              <br/>
              Elevated levels of iron can cause a metallic taste, bad smell, rusty-colored water, mineral deposits or sedimentation, or reddish or orange staining on laundry or surfaces that come in contact with the water.  None of these effects poses a health risk.<br/>
              <br/>
              Elevated levels of iron or manganese (commonly found together in water wells) may also cause the growth of iron or manganese bacteria, which produce a slime that can clog filters and plumbing. Although these bacteria can make water unappealing and cause a bad taste or smell, there is no health risk associated with them.<br/>

              <b>How can I reduce the level of iron in my water?</b>  Install an NSF/ANSI Standard 42 certified whole house oxidizing filter system that uses air as the oxidizing agent to reduce the level of iron in your water.  Your test results show that your water contains less than 0.1 mg/L of manganese, so using a strong oxidizing agent, such as chlorine or permanganate, is not needed.  This type of system will also reduce the level of arsenic in your water, if present; however, you did not provide test results for arsenic.  How much arsenic can be removed by this type of system depends on the levels of iron and arsenic.

              <b>Can consuming water containing lead affect my health?</b>  Consuming water containing more than 0.015 mg/L of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for babies, children, and pregnant women.<br/>
              <br/>
              Babies and children who consume water containing more than 0.015 mg/L of lead could experience long-term problems with physical and mental growth and development, including slowed body growth, kidney problems, hearing problems, seizures, brain damage, lower IQ level, trouble learning, reduced attention span, and behavior problems.<br/>
              <br/>
              Pregnant women and their unborn babies are especially at risk from consuming water containing more than 0.015 mg/L of lead.  Lead exposure can seriously harm the unborn baby, causing premature birth, lower birth weight, and delayed mental and physical development.<br/>
              <br/>
              Adults who consume water containing more than 0.015 mg/L of lead may be at higher risk for cancer, stroke, and high blood pressure and could develop nervous system problems, kidney problems, anemia, and decreased sperm production in men.<br/>
              <br/>
              The presence of lead in your water may also indicate that other pollutants, such as copper, may be present in your water.<br/>
              <br/>
              You can continue to use your water for washing food and dishes, brushing your teeth, bathing, showering, and for other uses, as these are not considered major sources of exposure.<br/>

                <li>
                  If you haven’t already done so, you should also test your water for copper.

                <br/>
                <li>
                  Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making baby food and formula. Hot water from the tap is likely to contain higher levels of lead and copper.  In most cases, you can reduce the level of lead and copper in the water that you use for drinking and cooking by clearing the water from the pipes before using it.  Click <a class="contaminant-link" data-contaminant="Pb1" style="cursor: pointer;">here</a> for instructions on flushing out your plumbing.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                  Lead (and copper) levels may be high in your water because of the materials used in your home’s plumbing and how acidic your water is.  Metals, such as lead and copper, can leach from pipes and plumbing fixtures when water is acidic.  If you haven’t already done so, you should also test the pH of your water, which will tell you if your water is acidic.<br/>
                  <br/>
                  If your water is acidic (pH is less than 7.0), install a whole house acid neutralizer system, such as a calcite filter, to increase the pH and make the water less acidic, which should reduce the level of lead (and copper) in your water.<br/>
                  <br/>
                  Another option is to remove the source of lead by replacing your lead or galvanized iron pipes and fittings, lead-soldered pipes, and brass or chrome fixtures with other approved materials, such as plastic.<br/>
                </li>
              </ol>

                In most cases, flushing out your plumbing will reduce the lead (and copper) level in your water. The routine of letting the water run to get the lead (and copper) out should be done each morning and if the water has not been used for more than six hours – for example, overnight or during the day when you have been out of the house.  To “flush the tap,” turn on the cold water faucet and let the water run for at least 15 seconds.  If you need hot water for drinking or cooking, take water from the cold water tap and heat it.<br/>
                <br/>
                Other household water uses, such as showering or toilet flushing, will also help clear water from your plumbing. Keep in mind that you will still need to run individual faucets for a short time before using them for cooking and drinking water. You may want to keep a container of water in your refrigerator, so that the water does not have to be run every time you need it.<br/>

              <b>Can consuming water containing copper affect my health?</b>  Consuming water containing more than 1.3 mg/L of copper can cause vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, and nausea.  Children under one year old have the highest risk of getting sick.  High levels of copper in water can also cause liver or kidney damage the longer you drink the water.  Also, if you or someone in your household has Wilson’s Disease, you should talk with your doctor about the level of copper in your water.  The presence of copper in your water may also indicate that other pollutants, such as lead, may be present in your water.<br/>
              <br/>
              You can continue to use your water for washing food and dishes, brushing your teeth, bathing, showering, and for other uses, as these are not considered major sources of exposure.<br/>

                <li>
                  If you haven’t already done so, you should also test your water for lead, which can cause serious health problems, especially for babies, children, and pregnant women.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                  Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making baby food and formula. Hot water from the tap is likely to contain higher levels of lead and copper.  In most cases, you can reduce the level of lead and copper in the water that you use for drinking and cooking by clearing the water from the pipes before using it.  Click <a class="contaminant-link" data-contaminant="Cu1" style="cursor: pointer;">here</a> for instructions on flushing out your plumbing.

                <br/>
                <li>
                  Copper (and lead) levels may be high in your water because of the materials used in your home’s plumbing and how acidic your water is.  Metals, such as copper and lead, can leach from pipes and plumbing fixtures when water is acidic.  When copper leaches from plumbing, it can cause water to have a metallic taste or cause blue-green staining on surfaces that come in contact with the water.  If you haven’t already done so, you should also test the pH of your water, which will tell you if your water is acidic.<br/>
                  <br/>
                  If your water is acidic (pH is less than 7.0), install a whole house acid neutralizer system, such as a calcite filter, to increase the pH and make the water less acidic, which should reduce the level of copper (and lead) in your water.<br/>
                  <br/>
                  Another option is to remove the source of copper by replacing your copper plumbing and fixtures with other approved materials, such as plastic.<br/>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <br/>

              <div Id="Cu1" style="display:none; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;">
                In most cases, flushing out your plumbing will reduce the copper (and lead) level in your water. The routine of letting the water run to get the copper (and lead) out should be done each morning and if the water has not been used for more than six hours – for example, overnight or during the day when you have been out of the house.  To “flush the tap,” turn on the cold water faucet and let the water run for at least 15 seconds.  If you need hot water for drinking or cooking, take water from the cold water tap and heat it.<br/>
                <br/>
                Other household water uses, such as showering or toilet flushing, will also help clear water from your plumbing. Keep in mind that you will still need to run individual faucets for a short time before using them for cooking and drinking water. You may want to keep a container of water in your refrigerator, so that the water does not have to be run every time you need it.<br/>

              <b>Can consuming water containing manganese affect my health?</b>  Consuming water containing more than 0.3 mg/L of manganese is not harmful to adults; however, it may be harmful to children.  Studies suggest that elevated levels of manganese may affect the brain development of children, possibly causing changes in behavior and a decreased ability to learn and remember.<br/>
              <br/>
              Pregnant women, babies, and children under three years old should not consume water containing 0.3 mg/L or more of manganese.  Extra care should be taken with formula-fed children, as certain formulas contain manganese, and if prepared with water that also contains manganese, the child may get a higher dose than the rest of the family.  To reduce your family’s exposure to manganese, treat the water that you use for drinking and cooking to reduce the level of manganese to be less than 0.3 mg/L or use an alternative source of water that contains less than 0.3 mg/L of manganese.<br/>
              <br/>
              Elevated levels of manganese can cause a metallic taste, bad smell, rusty-colored water, mineral deposits or sedimentation, or brown or black staining on laundry or surfaces that come in contact with the water.  None of these effects poses a health risk.<br/>
              <br/>
              Elevated levels of iron or manganese (commonly found together in water wells) may also cause the growth of iron or manganese bacteria, which produce a slime that can clog filters and plumbing. Although these bacteria can make water unappealing and cause a bad taste or smell, there is no health risk associated with them.<br/>

                To fix the total coliform bacteria problem in your well water, take these steps:
                <br/>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Inspect the condition of your wellhead and the area around it - check your well’s cap and casing to make sure there are no cracks or holes where bacteria can enter your well; and check for possible sources of pollution, such as septic systems, and waste from pets and farm animals.  Also, make sure rain and melting snow are directed away from your wellhead.  Click <a target="_blank" href="http://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/dwgb/well_testing/index.htm">here</a> for a checklist of what to look for from NHDES.  If you cannot find your wellhead, it may be buried and need to be dug up.
                  </li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>
                    Once you have taken care of any potential sources of pollution, disinfect your well and collect another water sample.  Click <a target="_blank" href="http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/pip/factsheets/dwgb/index.htm">here</a> for step-by-step instructions for disinfecting your well from NHDES.
                  </li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>
                    If the bacteria problem continues, it may indicate that there is a problem with the construction of your well that is allowing bacteria to easily enter it. In this case, consult a NH-licensed water well contractor to get an assessment of your well and have any construction-related problems fixed.  Click <a target="_blank" href="http://des.nh.gov/onestop/index.htm">here</a> to search for NH-licensed contractors that work in your area.
                  </li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>
                    If bacteria are present in your water after you have taken care of any potential pollution sources or well construction problems, you have the following options:
                    <ol type="a">
                      <li>Install an NSF/ANSI Standard 55 certified whole house Class A ultraviolet (UV) disinfection system, following the manufacturer’s requirements for pretreatment; or</li>
                      <li>Use an alternative source of water that is known to be safe, such as bottled water; or</li>
                      <li>Replace your well.</li>

              <b>Can consuming water containing gross alpha radioactivity affect my health?</b>  Consuming water containing gross alpha radioactivity at levels greater than 15 pCi/L is associated with an increased risk of cancer.  Your individual health risk depends on the amount of radioactivity in your water, how much of the water you drink each day, and the number of years you drink the water.  To reduce your exposure to gross alpha radioactivity in your well water, treat the water that you use for drinking and cooking to a level less than 15 pCi/L.  You can continue to use your water for washing food and dishes, brushing your teeth, bathing, showering, and for other uses.

              <b>How can I reduce the level of gross alpha radioactivity in my water?</b>  In addition to gross alpha radioactivity, your test results show that your water also contains more than 20 ug/L of uranium, which must be considered in the selection of a water treatment system.  Install an NSF/ANSI Standard 58 certified point-of-use (POU) reverse osmosis (RO) system at your kitchen sink to reduce the level of uranium and gross alpha radioactivity in the water that you consume.
