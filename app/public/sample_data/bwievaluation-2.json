      "HealthMessages": "&lt;b&gt;Can consuming water containing arsenic affect my health?&lt;/b&gt;  Consuming water containing more than 0.010 mg/L of arsenic is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the skin, bladder, lungs, kidneys, nasal passages, liver, or prostate as well as diseases of the nerves, lungs, heart, and immune and endocrine (hormonal) systems.  Your individual health risk depends on the amount of arsenic in your water, how much of the water you drink each day, and the number of years you drink the water.  To reduce your exposure to arsenic in your well water, treat the water that you use for drinking and cooking to a level less than 0.010 mg/L.

Install one of the following water treatment systems to reduce the level of iron, manganese, and arsenic in your water:\r\n              &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;\r\n              An NSF/ANSI Standard 42 certified whole house oxidizing filter system that uses chlorine or permanganate as the oxidizing agent to reduce the level of iron and manganese.  This type of system will also reduce the level of arsenic in your water, though by how much depends on the levels of iron, pH, and arsenic.  You may also need to install one of the following systems if additional arsenic reduction is needed:\r\n              &lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;An NSF/ANSI Standard 53 certified arsenic adsorption media filter system.

      "HealthMessages": "&lt;b&gt;Can consuming water containing manganese affect my health?&lt;/b&gt;  While manganese is necessary for normal immune system function, digestion, and bone strength, at elevated levels manganese could produce neurological effects. Consuming water containing more than 0.3 mg/L of manganese may be harmful to children.  Studies suggest that elevated levels of manganese may affect the brain development of children, possibly causing changes in behavior and a decreased ability to learn and remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n              Pregnant women, babies, and children under three years old should not consume water containing 0.3 mg/L or more of manganese for more than ten days.  Infants and children younger than 12 months old are potentially more susceptible to excess manganese because of their developing neurological and gastrointestinal systems.  Infants appear to absorb more manganese than older age children and adults but excrete less.   Extra care should be taken with formula-fed children, as certain formulas contain manganese, and if prepared with water that also contains manganese, the child may get a higher dose than necessary to meet nutritional needs.  To reduce your family’s exposure to manganese, treat the water that you use for drinking and cooking to reduce the level of manganese to be less than 0.3 mg/L or use an alternative source of water that contains less than 0.3 mg/L of manganese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n              Elevated levels of manganese can cause a metallic taste, bad smell, rusty-colored water, mineral deposits or sedimentation, or brown or black staining on laundry or surfaces that come in contact with the water.
