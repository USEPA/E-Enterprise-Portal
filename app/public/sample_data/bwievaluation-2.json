Hot water from the tap is likely to contain higher levels of lead and copper.  In most cases, you can reduce the level of lead and copper in the water that you use for drinking and cooking by clearing the water from the pipes before using it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;\r\n                  Lead (and copper) levels may be high in your water because of the materials used in your home’s plumbing and how acidic your water is.  Metals, such as lead and copper, can leach from pipes and plumbing fixtures when water is acidic.  If you haven’t already done so, you should also test the pH of your water, which will tell you if your water is acidic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                  If your water is acidic (pH is less than 7.0), install a whole house acid neutralizer system, such as a calcite filter, to increase the pH and make the water less acidic, which should reduce the level of lead (and copper) in your water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                  Another option is to remove the source of lead by replacing your lead or galvanized iron pipes and fittings, lead-soldered pipes, and brass or chrome fixtures with other approved materials, such as plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div Id=&quot;Pb1&quot; style=&quot;display:none; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;&quot;&gt;\r\n                In most cases, flushing out your plumbing will reduce the lead (and copper) level in your water. The routine of letting the water run to get the lead (and copper) out should be done each morning and if the water has not been used for more than six hours – for example, overnight or during the day when you have been out of the house.  To “flush the tap,” turn on the cold water faucet and let the water run for at least 15 seconds.  If you need hot water for drinking or cooking, take water from the cold water tap and heat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                Other household water uses, such as showering or toilet flushing, will also help clear water from your plumbing. Keep in mind that you will still need to run individual faucets for a short time before using them for cooking and drinking water. You may want to keep a container of water in your refrigerator, so that the water does not have to be run every time you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                Corrosive water can result in damage to plumbing which can also result in increased levels of lead and copper.

Consuming water containing more than 0.3 mg/L of manganese may be harmful to children.

Infants and children younger than 12 months old are potentially more susceptible to excess manganese because of their developing neurological and gastrointestinal systems.  Infants appear to absorb more manganese than older age children and adults but excrete less.   Extra care should be taken with formula-fed children, as certain formulas contain manganese, and if prepared with water that also contains manganese, the child may get a higher dose than necessary to meet nutritional needs.  To reduce your family’s exposure to manganese, treat the water that you use for drinking and cooking to reduce the level of manganese to be less than 0.3 mg/L or use an alternative source of water that contains less than 0.3 mg/L of manganese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n              Elevated levels of manganese can cause a metallic taste, bad smell, rusty-colored water, mineral deposits or sedimentation, or brown or black staining on laundry or surfaces that come in contact with the water.  None of these effects poses a health risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n              Elevated levels of iron or manganese (commonly found together in water wells) may also cause the growth of iron or manganese bacteria, which produce a slime that can clog filters and plumbing. Although these bacteria can make water unappealing and cause a bad taste or smell, there is no health risk associated with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n              For additional information see &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dep/water/drinking/alpha/i-thru-z/mangfactsheet.pdf&quot;&gt;MassDEP&#39;s Manganese Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;",

      "TreatmentMessages": "&lt;b&gt;What should I do?&lt;/b&gt;\r\n              To avoid getting sick from consuming water containing E. coli bacteria, boil all water that you use for drinking, brushing teeth, washing fruits and vegetables, food preparation, washing dishes, making baby food and formula, and making ice or use an alternative source of water that is known to be safe, such as bottled water, until the problem is fixed and E. coli bacteria are absent.  Water should be boiled for two minutes and cooled before using it. Dishes can be safely washed in a dishwasher if you use the hot water/sanitary cycle setting and the dry cycle. You can continue to use your water for bathing and showering as long as you do not drink it; extra care should be taken with small children.  To fix the E. coli bacteria problem in your well water, see the steps below.\r\n              &lt;div&gt;\r\n                To fix the E. coli bacteria problem in your well water, take these steps:\r\n                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;\r\n                E. coli bacteria in your water sample means there is a strong chance that human or animal waste is getting into your well.  Inspect the condition of your wellhead and the area around it - check your well’s cap and casing to make sure there are no cracks or holes where bacteria can enter your well; and check for possible sources of pollution, such as septic systems and waste from pets and farm animals.  Also, make sure rain and melting snow are directed away from your wellhead. If you cannot find your wellhead, it may be buried and need to be dug up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;\r\n                Once you have taken care of any potential sources of pollution, disinfect your well and collect another water sample.  See the Disinfection Section of the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/water/drinking/private-wells.html&quot;&gt;MassDEP Private Well Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for instructions on how to disinfect your well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;\r\n                If the bacteria problem continues, there may be a problem with the construction of your well that is allowing bacteria to easily enter it. In this case, contact an MA-certified well driller to get an assessment of your well and have any construction-related problems fixed.  Click &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/water/drinking/well-drillers-program.html &quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to search for MA-certified well drillers that work in your area.\r\n              &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;\r\n                If bacteria are present in your water after you have taken care of all potential pollution sources or well construction problems, you have the following options:\r\n                &lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install an NSF/ANSI Standard 55 certified whole house Class A ultraviolet (UV) disinfection system, following the manufacturer’s requirements for pretreatment; or&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use an alternative source of water that is known to be safe, such as bottled water; or&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace your well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

      "HealthMessages": "&lt;b&gt;Can radon affect my health?&lt;/b&gt;  Yes. Most of the risk from radon in water comes from breathing radon gas that is released into the air when water is used in the home. Radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in people who never smoke, and the second leading cause of lung cancer overall. The greater the exposure to radon, especially if you smoke cigarettes, the greater your chance of developing lung cancer. If you haven’t already done so, you should also test the air in your home for radon gas if you live below the third floor. A secondary concern is the risk of cancer associated with the ingestion of drinking water with radon.&lt;br /&gt;",
      "TreatmentMessages": "&lt;b&gt;How can I reduce my health risk from radon?&lt;/b&gt;In most cases, reducing the level of radon in air by preventing air from entering your house from the ground is more cost-effective than treating radon in water.  However, radon-in-water treatment is cost-effective in many cases, either in addition to radon-in-air mitigation or (in fewer situations) on its own. Testing of both your air and water, in consultation with a certified radon mitigation professional, will help you make a well-informed decision about the best way to reduce your exposure to radon).
