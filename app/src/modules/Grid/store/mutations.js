/**
 * Methods added here are available to the workbench applications. There
 * are no returned values. Changes should be atomic when possible.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Vue cannot detect property addition or deletion. Vue does not
 * allow dynamically adding new root-level reactive properties to an already
 * created instance. However, itâ€™s possible to add reactive properties to a
 * nested object using the Vue.set(object, key, value) method.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Mutations Must Be Synchronous. Only Synchronous methods will
 * be created here.
