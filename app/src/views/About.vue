                  The E-Enterprise for the Environment Portal is a new user-friendly web platform
                  that will modernize the way the public, regulated community, and environmental
                  co-regulators conduct environmental transactions and access web resources. EPA is
                  working with states and tribes to develop an interoperable portal integrating data
                  and functionality over time to create a dynamic tool for collaboration and
                  innovation.

                <p>The E-Enterprise for the Environment Portal will:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Decrease the time and effort needed to perform transactions with EPA, tribal,
                    state, and local governments
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Provide a more consistent way for environmental agencies to interact with
                    regulated entities and the public
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Allow the regulated community and the public to discover the information that
                    is important to them
